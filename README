== svn2git

+svn2git+ is a tiny utility for migrating projects from Subversion to Git while keeping
the trunk, branches and tags where they should be. It uses git-svn to clone an svn repository
and does some clean-up to make sure branches and tags are imported in a meaningful way, and
that the code checked into master ends up being what's currently in your svn trunk rather
than whichever svn branch your last commit was in.

=== Examples

Say I have this code in svn:

  trunk
    ...
  branches
    1.x
    2.x
  tags
    1.0.0
    1.0.1
    1.0.2
    1.1.0
    2.0.0

git-svn will go through the commit history to build a new git repo. It will import all branches
and tags as remote svn branches, whereas what you really want is git-native local branches and
git tag objects. So after importing this project I'll get:

  $ git branch
  * master
  $ git branch -a
  * master
    1.x
    2.x
    tags/1.0.0
    tags/1.0.1
    tags/1.0.2
    tags/1.1.0
    tags/2.0.0
    trunk
  $ git tag -l
  [ empty ]

After svn2git is done with your project, you'll get this instead:

  $ git branch
  * master
    1.x
    2.x
  $ git tag -l
    1.0.0
    1.0.1
    1.0.2
    1.1.0
    2.0.0

Finally, it makes sure the HEAD of master is the same as the current trunk of the svn repo.

=== Installation

Make sure you have git installed, then install the gem:

  $ sudo apt-get install git-core git-svn
  $ sudo gem install svn2git

=== Usage

To create a git repo from an existing svn repo:

  $ svn2git http://svn.yoursite.com/path/to/repo

This will create a git repository in the current directory with the git version of the svn
repository. If you're not using the standard trunk/branches/tags layout, you can pass arguments
to tell git-svn what to look for:

  $ svn2git http://svn.yoursite.com/path/to/repo trunk=the_trunk tags=taggings

=== Authors

To convert all your svn authors to git format, create a file somewhere on your system with
the list of conversions to make, one per line, for example:

  jcoglan = James Coglan <jcoglan@never-you-mind.com>
  stnick = Santa Claus <nicholas@lapland.com>

Then pass an +authors+ option to +svn2git+ pointing to your file:

  svn2git http://repos.com/myproject authors=~/authors.txt

Alternatively, you can place the authors file into ~/.svn2git/authors and svn2git will load
it out of there.  This allows you to build up one authors file for all your projects and
have it loaded for each repository that you migrate.
